## Briefly about myself:
My first profession is musicology. I have been studing piano and music theory since I was 5 years old. After writing my dissertation theses, I work at the Acadamy of Music.

Music and programming have something in common - they are mathematical principles and algorithms. So I started learning JS. Since I am a teacher myself, I made myself a plan for mastering frontend development. I took several courses on HTML and CSS on Hexlet, made a secetion of videos on youtube and educarional games for myself. In the future, I plan to move on to studing libraries and frameworks and move towards backend development.

## Skills and Proficiency:

    HTML5, CSS3
    JavaScript Basics
    Git, GitHub
    VS Code
    
## Code example:
**Quest from Hecklet (Introduction to Programming):**
Implement and export a default function that works like this:
A non-negative integer num is given. Add all the digits included in it until there is one digit left
```
const sumNum = (num) => {
  let num1 = String(num);
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < num1.length; i++) {
    sum = Number(num1[i]) + sum;
  };
  return sum;
};
const addDigits = (num) => {
let result = num;
    while (result >= 10) {
result = sumNum(result);
    };
    return result;
};
export default addDigits;
```

Every year I have the opportunity to speak English with musicians who come to an international music festival. I know that this is not enough. I have more practice in working with articles about music in English (I wrote a section about them in the dissertation thesis), so I can quite cope with reading the documentation in English
